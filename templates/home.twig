      <p>This month, we would like to focus our Spotlight on Dorothy O&#39;Connor. Dorothy is 87 years young and has been a member of NeuroFit for 1 year now! She attends the group fitness class SilverSneakers Cardio Circuit weekly. &#34;I love how great I feel!&#34; Dorothy said when we asked her what she loves most about SilverSneakers.</p>

      <p>Dorothy is the mother of 4 children and 13 grandchildren and 3 great-grandchildren. She loves keeping an active lifestyle outside of NeuroFit by gardening, swimming, and going on walks in the evenings. Dorothy was a high school English teacher for 30 years here in town.</p>
